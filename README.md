# Disclaimer
This repository is marked as public because it contains no sensitive code. Additionally, GitHub [requires](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-workflow-templates-for-your-organization#creating-a-workflow-template) the .github repository to be public for organization-wide starter workflow templates, which is why it was not set to private.
